REST API with ASP.NET Core to learn C#
Task manager API with CRUD
Using Swagger for testing

=> Controllers, dependency injection, database interaction using Entity Framework Core

=> Use Model View Controller (MVC) using ASP.NET Core for organization

Models: Defines the data structure - blueprint. Defines what a "task" looks like in db
DbContext: Handles database interactions and communication, store and retrieve tasks
Controllers: Handle API requests and return responses (define API endpoints: lets users interact with API with GET tasks, POST new tasks, etc) (e.g., /api/tasks)


Data Transfer Objects (DTO): Control what data is sent or recieved from API -> don't want to expose full model with sensitive fields
Service layer (Business logic): keeps controllers clean, we write logic inside to service class instead of inside controllers


Database Injection: allows us to inject services instead of manually creating DI's
Middleware: Handle requests and responses. Middleware are components that process requests BEFORE reaching controller, or AFTER response is sent=> helps with logging, auth, CORS, and error handling
Authentication and Authorization: For security, we use JWT Authentication here for securing API
CORS: Cross-Origin Requests, for API to be accessed from frontend app (vue, react, etc.) to make API requests
Logging: For tracking errors and debugging
Unit Testing: unit tests normal



First start with Models, DbContext, and Controllers to create basic API
Second add DTOs and Services to improve the structure
Secure API with Authentication and CORS
Implement logging and testing


# After edits done: rebuild and run API
```bash
docker build -t taskapi .
docker run --rm -it -v $(pwd):/app -p 5000:5000 taskapi
```

For JWT Authentication in Program.cs run:
```bash
docker run --rm -it -v $(pwd):/app -p 5000:5000 -e JwtSettings__Secret="YourVeryStrongSecretKeyWithAtLeast32Characters!" taskapi
```

# Setup, Models, DbContext, Controllers, Running:
1. Install .NET sdk (not needed if you will be using my given Dockerfile => recommended)
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/install/linux

I am using Docker container for .NET environment since my fedora 37 isn't supported
Ensure that Docker is installed


2. Run terminal inside .NET container (I am running mounted volume so I can work on files in local system)

Mounted volume: (use mounted volume to run docker terminal)
```bash
docker run --rm -it -v $(pwd):/app -w /app mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/sdk:8.0 /bin/bash
```

Non mounted volume (can use after setup is complete, for now use mounted volume):
```bash
docker run --rm -it mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/sdk:8.0 /bin/bash
```

3. Create project inside mounted directory

```bash
dotnet new webapi -o TaskApi
cd TaskApi
```

4. Create Model directory inside TaskApi, and create TaskModels.cs => Represents task in database (use [key], [Required] to enforce rules)

5. Create Data directory inside TaskApi, and create AppDbContext.cs => 1st. Connect DbContext to connect to database, & 2nd. Define task table using DbSet<TaskModel>

6. Configure Database in appsettings.json (Using sqlite) => create and add database connection "ConnectionStrings"

7. Register Database in current Program.cs. Register AppDbContext so ASP.NET can use it, and enable Swagger UI for testing API, edit current Program.cs to use SQLite (// Register SQLite Database Context)

8. Create Task Controller (TasksControllers.cs) inside created Controllers/ directory. Has CRUD endpoints (GET tasks => get all tasks, GET tasks/id => Get single task with id, POST task => Create new task, PUT tasks/id => Update task with id, DELETE tasks/id => Delete a task with id)

9. Apply Database Migrations (Should only need to do once, persists from Dockerfile line: ENV PATH="/root/.dotnet/tools:$PATH"
)

# Create Tasks table in DB (if doesn't work, see below):
```bash
dotnet ef migrations add InitialCreate
dotnet ef database update
```
Fixing errors:
(Might need to install dotnet.ef tool and add to path):

To run docker container terminal: inside of TaskApi dir run: 
```bash
docker run --rm -it -v $(pwd):/app -w /app mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/sdk:8.0 /bin/bash
```

Inside docker container install dotnet.ef run:
```bash
dotnet tool install --global dotnet-ef
```
For adding to path:
```bash
export PATH="$PATH:/root/.dotnet/tools"
```
Confirm installation is working:
```bash
dotnet ef --version
```

(Might need to install Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Design in local terminal INSIDE of docker container terminal):
```bash
dotnet add package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Design
```
Check installation:
```bash
dotnet list package
```

Finally after installing, retry these two INSIDE of docker container terminal:
```bash
dotnet ef migrations add InitialCreate
dotnet ef database update
```

Containers reset when restarted, so need to nodify Dockerfile to install dotnet-ef when container starts, or use persistent volume for db files

------------------------------------------

10. Run & Test API:
<!-- 
```bash
docker run
``` -->
(Make sure you are exited outside of Docker)
```bash
docker build -t taskapi .
```

or if changes made use this to rebuild:
```bash
docker build --no-cache -t taskapi .
```

then:
```bash
docker run --rm -it -v $(pwd):/app -v $(pwd)/data:/root/.dotnet/tools -p 5000:5000 taskapi
```

=> Swagger opens at https://localhost:5000/swagger

# when done developing:
```bash
docker run --rm -it -v $(pwd):/app -p 5000:5000 taskapi
```

For JWT Authentication in Program.cs run:
```bash
docker run --rm -it -v $(pwd):/app -p 5000:5000 -e JwtSettings__Secret="YourVeryStrongSecretKeyWithAtLeast32Characters!" taskapi
```


# Transfer permissions to save/modify files:

ls -lah

sudo chown -R $USER:$USER .

sudo chmod -R u+rwx .

maybe restart vscode 

exit  # If you're inside Docker, exit first
code .  # Reopen your project



# DTOs and Service Layer
11. Create DTOs/TaskDTO.cs => controls what data is sent and recieved by API, prevents exposing sensitive fields & allows for more structured API responses 
=> Prevent exposing 'Id' field (or other sensitve data), helps mapping data between different layers

12. Create Services Layer (Services/TaskService.cs)=> Separate logic from controllers (TaskControllers.cs), code is reusable, better for testing.
Need to modify current TaskControllers to use new Services from TaskService.cs (done)

Need to register new TaskService in current Program.cs (done)

# Dependency Injection for Database
13. Modify Program.cs to make sure db connection properly injected

# Custom Middleware
14. Create Middleware/CustomMiddleware.cs for handling logging, error handling, or modifying req before reaching controllers (done), register in Program.cs (#13)
// Logs request body, logs response body, ensures stream positions reset so pipeline cont normally, also tracks time taken for tasks to execute

# JWT Authentication and Authorization
15. Added JWT Auth in Program.cs, use secret key in Dockerfile run instead of storing inside of program.cs
docker run --rm -it -v $(pwd):/app -p 5000:5000 -e JwtSettings__Secret="YourVeryStrongSecretKeyWithAtLeast32Characters!" taskapi

Need to do one time: Install required packages for JWT
Run interactive session
```bash
docker run --rm -it -v $(pwd):/app -w /app mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/sdk:8.0 /bin/bash
```
Then install package versions for JWT Auth:
```bash
dotnet add package Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.JwtBearer --version 8.0.2
dotnet add package Microsoft.IdentityModel.Tokens --version 8.0.2
```
=> Implemented JWT token generation

=> Configured JWT authentication in Program.cs

=> Modified TasksController to require authentication - Protected Routes in TaskController with [authorize]

=> Fixed JWT Secret key issues (32 chars + pass as env variable when running as docker cmd: docker run --rm -it -v $(pwd):/app -p 5000:5000 -e JwtSettings__Secret="YourVeryStrongSecretKeyWithAtLeast32Characters!" taskapi)

=> Fixed data protection warnings about persistent encryption keys only in production 
- ensure persistent key storage in Docker by mounting volume when running: docker run --rm -it -v $(pwd)/data-protection:/app/DataProtection-Keys -v $(pwd):/app -p 5000:5000 -e JwtSettings__Secret="YourVeryStrongSecretKeyWithAtLeast32Characters!" taskapi

# Cors
16. For now CORS allows all origins, methods, and headers (modify later)

<!-- 2️⃣ Add Custom Middleware
Middleware helps handle logging, error handling, or modifying requests before they reach controlle -->

<!-- 4️⃣ CORS (Will Enable Fully Later for Frontend)
For now, allow all requests (we will refine this when the fronte -->



=======> add Role-Based Authorization (RBAC) using JWT claims next 









to run 

docker build --no-cache -t taskapi .
docker run --rm -it -v $(pwd):/app -p 5000:5000 -e JwtSettings__Secret="YourVeryStrongSecretKeyWithAtLeast32Characters!" taskapi
